# pyMiniOS

A toy operating system simulation written in Python. `pyMiniOS` is **not** a real kernel or OS â€” instead, it's a learning playground that mimics a shell environment with basic command handling, a virtual filesystem, and simulated OS behaviors.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clxrityy/pyMiniOS.git # Clone the repository
cd pyMiniOS # Navigate to the directory
python3 main.py # Run the simulation
```

#### Running in a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
python3 main.py # Run the simulation
deactivate # Deactivate the virtual environment
```
