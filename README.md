## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clxrityy/pyMiniOS.git # Clone the repository
cd pyMiniOS # Navigate to the directory
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
python3 main.py # Run the simulation
```

#### Running in a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
python3 main.py # Run the simulation
deactivate # Deactivate the virtual environment
```

## Installation
> Installs the required dependencies and sets up the environment for running the interface globally.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh # Make the script executable
./install.sh # Run the installation script

pymini # Run the simulation
```
